# productivityapp
### This is a productivity app where on of the components is a to do list. Something I liked about my to do list is how it works, the to do list is an unodered list where it add the text from the input into the li tag by the javascript. Something that I could improve is how to delete the items that was inputted though the list as right now I have a reset button which delete every li tag in the div tag which is inconvenient when you want to cross out and delete on item off the list.
